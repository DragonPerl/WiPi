# WiPi
XS-File to use the WiringPi Library in a Perl skript [testing state]

I figured out that Perl can work with C-Librarys using an XS-File.
This works like a glue petween the Perl-Skript and the C-Library. 

I wrote this XS-File to use the functions of the WiringPi Library, written by Drogon, in a Perl-Skript. 

To use it you have to install the WiringPi-library first. 
To do so, go to the following link: 
http://wiringpi.com/download-and-install/
There you can find a description on how to install it. 

At this point I want to thank Drogan for this amazing library!!!
It is very easy to use and feels realy like programming a Arduino. 



DESCRIPTION OF THE ACTUAL VERSION OF "WiPi":

The first version coming soon will provide the basic funktions like
digital read or write a GPIO-Pin and write a PWM-Value to a pin. 

For mor information look at the Table below to see the actual functions.
